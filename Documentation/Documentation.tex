\chapter{Competency questions and use cases}
\section{Competency questions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Is item X compatible with model Y?
  \item Is item X compatible only with model Y?
  \item What models are compatible with item X?
  \item Is item X$_1$ compatible with item X$_2$?
  \item Is item X standard or optional?
  \item Is model Y an electric vehicle?
  \item What interior trim options are there for model Y?
  \item Does item X$_1$ include item X$_2$?
  \item Is item X an interior or exterior item?
  \item Is model Y available with large wheels?
  \item Is a glass roof available for model Y?
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Cases}
The main use cases are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finding out which configuration items are compatible with the desired vehicle
  \item Checking the compatibility of the items between themselves
  \end{itemize}

\chapter{Concepts}
The Car Configuration ontology is used for configuring a vehicle with the desired options.
Therefore, the options have to be divide into categories, and rules established for selecting items from them, so as to fit together.
Below is the preliminary classification of car configuration items:

\begin{center}
    \pgfimage[width=10cm]{car_config_ontology.png}
\end{center}

We have split the vehicles into two categories: electric and with combustion engines. The optional items are then split into Exterior and Interior items, where you would find your usual expected items.
Using this classification, we will be able to defines rules that specify that you may only choose one item from Wheels, but more then one item from Tech, for example.

Below is an extract from the Taxonomy page of Racer:

\begin{center}
    \pgfimage[width=15cm]{taxonomy.png}
\end{center}

\chapter{ABox}
We will briefly show the structure and knowledge present in the knowledge base

\chapter{Roles}
The roles we have defined are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item isCompatibleCarItem
    \item isCompatibleItemItem
    \item isIncluded
    
\end{itemize}

The role \textit{isCompatibleCarItem} defines which equipment items are compatible with a specified model, while the role \textit{isCompatibleItemItem} defines which items are compatible between each other. For example, two different sets of wheels are incompatible, since only one type of wheel can be selected in a car configuration.

\bigskip
The role \textit{isIncluded} specifies which items are included in other items, for example, the blind spot monitoring system is included in the full autopilot system.

\bigskip
Additionally, we have defined two additional attributes for each equipment item: \textit{price} and \textit{optional}, which show the price of an item and whether it is given as standard or it is an option. Standard equipment costs nothing.

\bigskip
Below is the formal declaration of the roles from above:
\bigskip

\textit{(define-primitive-role isCompatibleCarItem :domain CarType :range Item)}

\textit{(define-primitive-role isCompatibleItemItem :domain Item :range Item  :symmetric t)}

\textit{(define-primitive-role isIncluded :domain Item :range Item :asymmetric t)}

\chapter{Rules}
We have defined a rule that propagates the compatibility of a items to a vehicle model, when an item includes another item:

\begin{center}
    \textit{(define-rule (?car ?item2 isCompatibleCarItem)}
    
    \textit{(and (?car CarType) (?item1 Item) (?item2 Item) (not (same-as ?item1 ?item2))}
    
    \textit{(?car ?item1 isCompatibleCarItem) (?item2 ?item1 isIncluded))) }

\end{center} 

Meaning that vehicle ?car and item ?item2 are deemed compatible if there is another item ?item1 with which ?car is compatible and which also includes ?item2.

\bigskip
For example, if a vehicle is compatible with the FullAutopilot item, which includes the BlindSpotMonitor item, it then means that the vehicle is also compatible with the BlindSpotMonitor, however not at the same time.

\bigskip
In order to infer which items are compatible with other items, we decided to use the Racer Java API, since defining a set of rules that would produce this result in racer syntax proved too difficult.

We defined two items that are compatible as being from different sets. For example, a glass roof is compatible with 19' wheels, since they do not interfere with each other. However, 19; wheels are not compatible with 20' wheels, since a vehicle can only have one type of item from the Wheels category. Code is included in later chapters.  

\bigskip
It is also possible to count the instances of a set and, for example, say that only one item of some categories can be selected, but more from another category, like Safety for example. However, we removed the need for this extra verification by combining the items in item packs, that are like upgrades, with each pack containing the features of the previous pack, plus additional ones.

\bigskip
For example, the item HeatedSeats includes the item RegularSeats, which are both in the Seats category, meaning that only one can be selected as a configuration. The same goes for the FullAutopilot item, which includes the BlindSpotMonitor item and are both part of the Safety category. This way we can ensure that only one item from each category is selected.

\bigskip
Additionally, we have defined an extra rule that is applied between items with inclusions. It implements the transitivity property of the inclusion of items, which could not be defined in the rule definition of the \textit{isIncluded} role, due to the fact that inclusion is assimetrical:

\begin{center}

    \textit{(define-rule (?item1 ?item3 isIncluded)}
    
    \textit{(and (?item1 Item) (?item2 Item) (?item3 Item) (not (same-as ?item1 ?item2)) (not (same-as ?item2 ?item3)) (not (same-as ?item1 ?item3))}
    
    \textit{(?item1 ?item2 isIncluded) (?item2 ?item3 isIncluded))) }
    
\end{center} 

\chapter{FRED}
We attempted to use FRED in order to turn 2 natural language affirmations (Influenza can be treated with antibiotics, a myth, and Influenza can only be treated with antivirals, the truth) into ontologies.

After creating 2 ontologies, we merged them by using Protege and simplified them by hand, in order to disprove this myth.

\chapter{Racer Python API}
We have used the \textit{Racer Python API} to populate our ontology.

\section{Obtaining the project files}
We downloaded the project files from Moodle, and included them in a PyCharm folder.


\begin{center}
    \pgfimage[width=6cm]{PycharmFolders.png}
\end{center}

\section{Establishing a connection}
In order to establish a connection to the Racer server, it has to first be running in the background (otherwise an exception will be thrown). 

Once the Racer server starts, we can can connect to it using the following syntax:

\begin{center}
    \pgfimage[width=17cm]{Connection.png}
\end{center}

Once the connection has been established, we can directly interact with our technology, with no need for the Racer Porter program.

\section{Populating our ontology}
We attempted to use our Python program in order to populate our ontology with various instances in order to simplify our work. We did this by aggregating a list of viruses from the internet, taking 15 random samples, and adding them directly to our ontology:

\begin{center}
    \pgfimage[width=17cm]{Code.png}
\end{center}

\section{Results}
As can be seen from the image below, 15 random viruses were added to our ontology:

\begin{center}
    \pgfimage[width=17cm]{Results.png}
\end{center}


\chapter{Ontology Verbalization}
\section{Introduction}
We used an ontology verbalization tool in order to convert our ontology into (something closer to) natural language.

\section{Steps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We converted our ontology from Racer syntax to OWL syntax, using RacerPorter.
    \item We converted our OWL syntax ontology to a OWL2 syntax one using https://www.ldf.fi/service/owl-converter/
    \item We converted our ontology to natural language by using http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/docs/owl\_to\_ace.html
    
\end{itemize}
